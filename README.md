System Analysis and Design 

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? <br>
 The DriverPass project was about the design of a system for the driving school of the same name. The client wanted a system where students could take practice tests, access learning material, and schedule road lessons in an online, web-based environment. My job was to design the system, work out its requirements, and develop certain design documentation, diagrams, and charts.

What did you do particularly well? <br>
  I think the functional, non-functional, and technical requirements I had laid out were well-constructed and well-detailed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? <br>
  I think the Gantt chart could be more detailed and better formatted. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? <br>
  I used the interview as well as the functional, and non-functional requirements to interpret the user's needs with use-case, activity, and sequence diagrams to visualize them tangibly. These needs are so important because any system is created to fulfill its user's needs. It is the base requirement of any system, so they must be taken into account when designing.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? <br>
  The first thing that needs to happen is to gain an understanding of what the user's needs are and what the software needs to do to fulfill those needs. With this understanding, you can build requirements for your software and figure out how it can fulfill these requirements, _functionally_, and what you need to create that functionality. From here you can create diagrams and charts to relay your design to others and schedule development.
